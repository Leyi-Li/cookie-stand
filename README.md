# cookie-stand

In the Monday branch:
1. I created an object for each location. I also made an array for each hours.
2. I added some properties and a method in the object.
3. I used the Math.random() to calculate how many cookies might be sold per hour and create an element plus putting the cookie number sold hourly into the element content. And then append the new element to its parent element.
4. After doing the JavaScript I put it for the sales.html.
5. I put basic stuff into my front page(index.html) and used some CSS to make it look better.

In the Tuesday branch:
1. Replace all the object literals with constructior function with instances inside.
2. call new to create each location's object.
3. Replace the list with a table.
   (first row will be hrs and daily location total  
    middle rows will be different location's cookies num
    last row will be the totals for each hr for each location)
4. eache location should have a separate render()metod that creates and appends its row to the table
5. header and footer row get their own function
6. commit oftenly for what I did for the branch.
